# Hybrid-Pulse-Resonance-Framework
A novel lightweight integration framework that aims to integrate the concepts of frequency domain analysis and inter-arrival time monitoring in network security.

We introduce the Hybrid Pulse-Resonance Framework (HPRF), which combines spectral analysis of packet inter-arrival times with adaptive resonance frequency monitoring to create a computationally efficient intrusion detection mechanism.

The data used in the original experimentation is too large to be attached within the repository.
